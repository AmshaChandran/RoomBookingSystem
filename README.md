## Admin Features

The **admin** can:
- **Manage Rooms**: Add, update, and delete rooms.
- **Check Payment Status**: Admin can view and verify the payment status of bookings.
- **Update Room Availability**: Based on the payment status, the admin can update room availability (e.g., mark as unavailable if booked and paid).

## Customer Features

Customers can:
- Browse available rooms and their details.
- Register a new account and log in to manage bookings.

## PayPal Payment Integration

PayPal integration allows customers to make payments after booking a room. The process is as follows:

1. **Booking**: Customers select a room and book. After booking, proceed to checkout via PayPal.
2. **Payment**: Customers are redirected to PayPal to complete the payment.
3. **Confirmation**: Upon successful payment, the room availability is updated, and the booking is confirmed. Admin can also manually verify the payment status.
